# Aerial
Aerial is a command line based AI assistant with the ability to access different online services and local computer functionality.  
This project is divided into 2 parts:  

## The CLI
The bulk of the project is not in its AI but in the `aerial-utils` CLI written in Rust with [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap). The CLI is split into modules, each encompassing different functionalities.
The CLI is very user-friendly, with descriptions of the modules and commands built in, and can be used alone.  

Existing modules: music (via Spotify)

## The AI
The AI part of the project, under `aerial-ai`, is written in python, and uses the OpenAI API with the selected ChatGPT model.
The model can run any commands supported by the CLI, and knows which commands they are and what they do by the `tools-spec.json` file, which can be automatically generated by the the CLI using `command-specs`.

## Setup
* To set up the CLI `cd` into `aerial-utils` and run `cargo build` (assuming you have [cargo installed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)).  
  * You should now be able to run `.utils <command>` to use the CLI (the `.utils` file is just a symlink to the binary `target/debug/aerial-utils`).  
* To set up the AI create a python virtual enviorment and install the requirements from `requirements.txt`. Then for it to be able to access the CLI, copy `aerial-uils/target/debug/aerial-utils` to `aerial-ai`.  
* Additionally, some configuration is needed, configuration for the AI is under `aerial-ai/config_ai.toml` and for the CLI is under `aerial-ai/config.toml`, same as `aerial-utils/config.toml`.  
  * See `aerial-ai/config_ai_example.toml` and `aerial-utils/config_example.toml` and fill in your personal data under the appropriate files.  
* The `aerial-ai/tools-spec.json` should match the binary, but just in case you can run (in `aerial-ai`) `./aerial-utils command-specs > tools-spec.json`
